🌍 The world becomes more and more complex every day, just think of the exponential acceleration in the ability to generate technological innovations or to launch new products and services on the market.
The reality that surrounds us is constantly evolving, and man's task alternates between being the architect and keeping up with it.

Managing complexity is the soft essential to excel at work and in life:
- observation is a fundamental activity to understand the way the context evolves and to keep up to date
- specialisation becomes essential to become a cog in the whole.
